                I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman, and child in this country is innocent. 
                And that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque!"
                Based in the heart of New Mexico, Saul Goodman & Associates is not your average, buttoned-up law firm. 
                With a reputation for unconventional, high-energy advocacy, Saul Goodman specializes in criminal defense for the everyday citizen and the legally misunderstood. 
                Whether you are facing a minor traffic violation or complex, high-stakes legal trouble, Saul bends the law like a banjo string to get you the results you deserve.
